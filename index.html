    <h1>NEW YORK CITY</h1>

  <div class="para">
    New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch
    colonists in approximately 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was
    chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles
    II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city was regained by the Dutch in July
    1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since
    November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,and has been the largest
    U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the
    late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S.and its ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st
    century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship, and environmental
    sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. In 2019, New York was voted the
    greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural
    diversity.
